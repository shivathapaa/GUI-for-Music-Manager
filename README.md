# GUI for Music Manager

## Overview

The Music Collection Manager is a Python-based desktop application that allows you to manage and organize your music collection. It provides a user-friendly interface for renaming music files, filtering files based on extensions, finding duplicates, and moving them to a different folder.

This application consists of three main components:

1. **Music Management:**
   - Organize your music files by renaming them based on their tags. 
   - Handles various music file formats, including MP3, FLAC, WAV, and many more.
   - Offers quite a variety of file name formats to choose from:
     - Title
     - Title - Artist (e.g. Blinding Lights  - The Weeknd)
     - Title - Album (e.g. Blinding Lights  - After Hours)
     - Artist - Title
     - Title - Album Artist
   - Has options to choose a file name separator for separating tags:
     - Hyphen  --  "Name - Name" (e.g. Blinding Lights  - The Weeknd)
     - Small brackets  --  "Name (Name)" (e.g. Blinding Lights (The Weeknd))
   - Lets you to choose the destination folder names in different formats:
     - Artist (e.g. The Weeknd)
     - Album (e.g. After Hours)
     - Album Artist
   - You can choose to keep the *Track Number* when renaming the file.
   - You can keep track of files with the help of a feedback box (displays counter and details).
   - User-friendly GUI with options to select source and destination folders along with other different options as described above.


2. **File Filtering:**
   - Quickly filter and separate specific file types (e.g., MP3, M4A, txt, bmp, docs, mp4, etc.) from your collection.
   - Choose your own file type to filter. You can add custom file types to the filter.
   - Helps you keep your collection organized by separating different music file types.
   - Here too, you will get a feedback box to make it easier to track your files.
   - User-friendly GUI with an option to add your own custom extension.


3. **Filter Duplicates:**
- Filters music files by selecting different comparison options. It mainly uses the metadata of the file rather than the filename. You get to choose from the following options:
  - Title
  - Artist
  - Album
  - Album Artist
  - Title and Artist
  - Title and Album
  - Title and Album Artist
- This script can handle a wide range of music file types, ensuring compatibility with popular formats like .mp3, .flac, .wav, .aif, .m4a, and more.
- The script provides detailed feedback and error messages, keeping you informed about the progress of the filtering process.
- User-friendly GUI making it accessible to users of all experience levels.

  > **Note:** *Think Twice before choosing a single tag option for this filter operation.*

  This does not check for the file extensions while comparing, so I recommend first to filter files using the program ***File Filtering*** (inside the main GUI) option if necessary.


## Features

## Usage Instructions/Notes

- This application has been tested with extreme cases to extend, for checking its reliability.
- It has been tested with thousands of similar and dissimilar music files. (Gives 100% accuracy. No doubt!)
  > In spite of the best performance, I still recommend you to ensure that you have a backup copy of your music files before using the application.<br>You should be responsible for your own files.
