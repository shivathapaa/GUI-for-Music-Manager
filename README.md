# GUI for Music Manager

This Python application helps you manage and filter your music collection. It offers two main features:

1. **Music Management:**
   - Organize your music files by renaming them based on their tags. 
   - Handles various music file formats, including MP3, FLAC, WAV, and many more.
   - It offers quite a variety of file name formats to choose from:
     - Title
     - Title - Artist
     - Artist - Title
     - Title - Album
     - Title - Album Artist
   - It lets you choose a file name separator for separating tags:
     - Hyphen  --  "Name - Name"
     - Small brackets  --  "Name (Name)"
   - It lets you choose the destination folder names in different formats:
     - Artist
     - Album
     - Album Artist
   - You can keep track of files with the help of a feedback box (displays counter and details).


2. **File Filtering:**
   - Quickly filter and separate specific file types (e.g., MP3, M4A, txt, bmp, docs, mp4, etc.) from your collection.
   - Choose your own file type to filter. You can add custom file types to the filter.
   - Helps you keep your collection organized by separating different music file types.
   - Here too, you will get a feedback box to make it easier to track your files.


2. **Filter Duplicates:**
> *Think Twice before choosing single tag option for this filter operation.*
- this doesnot check for the extensions so i recommend to first filter file using the program File Filtering.
